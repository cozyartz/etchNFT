## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

# ðŸšŽ EtchNFT â€“ Bring Your NFTS Into the Physical World

*Turn your digital art and NFTS into beautiful, laser-etched physical plaques.*

Users connect their wallets, select an NFT they own, and order a high-quality etched version â€“ perfecpfor display, gifting, or provenance. Payments can be made via card (Square) or crypto (ETH/USDC).

â€¢ EtchNFT bridges the gap between digital ownership and real-world expression.

---

## ðŸŽ¤ Mission

> To empower artists and collectors to *capture physically* their digital ownership, increasing the value, emotion, and permanence of on-chain assets.

---

## ðŸ“» Why Itâ€¦
- Digital art is booming â€” but most NFTS live in cold wallets or screens.
- EtchNFT creates *real-life utility and pride of ownership*.
- The physical product + Web3 receipts = collectibles with real-world resonance.
