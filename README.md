*Turn your digital art and NFTS into beautiful, laser-etched physical plaques.*

Users connect their wallets, select an NFT they own, and order a high-quality etched version â€“ perfecpfor display, gifting, or provenance. Payments can be made via card (Square) or crypto (ETH/USDC).

â€¢ EtchNFT bridges the gap between digital ownership and real-world expression.

## ğŸ“» Why Itâ€¦
